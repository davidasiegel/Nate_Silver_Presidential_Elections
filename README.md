# Nate_Silver_Presidential_Elections

I wanted to know if the predicted win probability matches the actual win rate, as a function of time.  If Nate Silver's results are well-calibrated, then any prediction with a 60% win probability will have roughly 60% wins.  Ideally, not 70% and not 50%.

How well do his predictions work?

First, let me apologize.  This is basically the first time I'm using github and my data formatting also isn't ideal.  Feel free to contact me with suggestions.

## I'll walk you through the python notebook:

At the top, I load the data.

I wanted to look at the predictive accuracy as a function of time, so I split up each 

If you scroll down through the python notebook, the first graph ("Win Rate vs Predicted Rate") shows the predicted win rate on the x-axis and the actual win rate on the y-axis.
